# mod_db8404errors
Joomla Administrator Module to show a list of 404 Errors in the Cpanel of your Joomla website.


The 404 Errors can be seen in the Redirect Manager too. But having a list in the admin back-end, that is visible for administrators right after login, might be more effective.

Language files included: de-DE, en-GB, es-ES, fr-FR, nl-NL, no-NO
